Why

Hey! yeah! hey!
Skrrrr! I love you... skrrrr!
Hey! yeah! hey!

With my heart and my soul I look in your eyes
And the way that I feel, girl, I can't deny
With my gang and my dawgs we live in the wild
Girl I send a lotta texts buh you don't reply
Why? yay
I just wonder why, I just wonder why
And I travelled miles

Damn girl, you know, I travelled miles
I want you in my life, girl I want you in my life
Even if it's for a little while
I wanna see you smile, girl I wanna see you smile
See you smile (yah), for a while (yah)
Can you try (yah), hold you tight (yahy)

Ay! I said hi! (ay)
She said 'who you is?' (ay)
I said remmy boy (ooh)
She said we don't fit (ay)
Girl, gimme a chance (ay)
Cuz of that I'd burst up the ground (ay)
I know I wasn't in school (ooh)
She be like what do you do (yeah)
You ain't got no cash (ay)
You look so so razz (ay)
I am not your type (ay)
Damn I almost cried (ay)

I know you are hard to get and I'm not the one
I know you would find me when I'm moving on
Maybe cuz I had no cash and I wasn't cool
And you treated me so bad, I felt like a fool

Why? yay
I wish you was mine, I wish you was mine, I wish you was mine
With my heart and my soul I look in your eyes
And the way that I feel man I can't deny
All my gang, all my dawgs we live in the wild
Girl I send a lotta texts buh you don't reply

Why? yay
I just wonder why, I just wonder why
And I travelled miles
Damn girl you know I travelled miles
I want you in my life, girl I want you in my life
Even if it's for a little while
I wanna see you smile, girl I wanna see you smile
See you smile (yah), for a while (yah)
Can you try (yah), hold you tight (yahy)

Damn girl you know I travelled miles
I want you in my life, girl I want you in my life
Even if it's for a little while
I wanna see you smile, girl I wanna see you smile
See you smile (yah), for a while (yah)
Can you try (yah), hold you tight (yahy)
