Dirty

Girl I never wanna see you sober
Come rest upon my shoulder
The key to my heart dey for your key holder (Yai-ya-hi)
She like it when I rub on her head
She like it when I rub on her back
She tell me baby don't stop that (Yai-ya-hi)

She say she wanna get a little dirty as she rub on my chest
Shawty start to give me sloppy sloppy, she make a man confess
She make a man go

Push me to the limit wey I go shout shout shout shout
Hold me down down down down
