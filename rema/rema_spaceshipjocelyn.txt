(I don't wanna die
I'm too young
I don't wanna die
Jocelyn Jocelyn Jocelyn
Celyn celyn celyn
Jocelyn Jocelyn Jocelyn
Celyn celyn celyn

Celyn celyn)

Holy Divine
Crossed the line
Give me a sign
I'm one of a kind
Feelin' my wave
I'm losing my mind
She can't deny
I'm one of a kind
Look at my chain
I drip and I shine
Drip and I shine
Drip and I shine
She loves the way I drip and I shine
Look in my eyes the vision is high

Ou Divine
This is a ride
I'm in lane
I'm sipping my wine
She told me, babe let's do it again
Bring that shit back yo baby rewind
I like the way our body collide
Me and my gang, we live in the wild
Ou yeah, don't be a snitch
Ou yeah, face your defeat
Hmm

Spaceship in my eyes
Spaceship in my eyes
I cannot lie
Girl, I cannot lie
I'm gonna cry
Girl, I'm gonna cry
Girl, I'm gonna cry
Need you beside
You beside

Hmm I broke her heart
She bled, she died
I want, I want
You know that you I want
I'm on some drug
I'm gone, I'm gone
I told her to leave me alone
I told her, no baby I'm fine
Why why
Is love a fucking crime
It is the source of life
I guess I'm gonna hide
Hmm hide
I'm gonna hide my pride
I guess I can't define

Leave me alone
(Leave me alone)
I'm in my zone
(I'm in my zone)
I'm in the cold
(I'm in the cold)
Leave me alone
I'm in my zone, yeah

Holy Divine
Crossed the line

I'm one of a kind
Look at my chain

Drip and I shine
Drip and I shine
She loves the way I drip and I shine
