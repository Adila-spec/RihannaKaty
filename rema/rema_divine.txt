Divine

(Sarz way)

Make nobody come against what me I believe in
If you come against my vision you know that its treason
It's been a long time I had this feeling I was chosen
Situations that I came across made my heart frozen
Momma told me she was worried when I was in her belly
She said she had my brother and my sister okey-dokey
Then it took her four years before she even took in
Came a detox of blood that was a sign she was ready
She said I never kicked she said I never turned
She said I never caused her any discomfort
And she no dey at ease for like nine months
E be like say this pikin no wan gree comot
Say me I dey at peace I no even apply no force
And then she had a thought that maybe there might be a cause
Ou yeah she started worrying worrying about a lot
She went to the hospital without no remorse
And then she met a doctor (Doctor)
Tell me what is happening to my son (My son)
Am I being attacked by a rival (By a rival)
It's not making sense what do I do (Then what she say)
She said doctor I'm not feeling fine
Tell me this could be a sign
And he said it is time she gave birth and named me Divine

Yunno yunno
Nothing fit come against my destiny
I fight battles wey nobody ever see
As I dey this industry with God company
Me I go kaku so make everybody see
Script wey God mark you wan cancel it
English no correct make nobody bother me
You can laugh at me talk down on me God cover me
Ye ye ye ye ye ye ye ye ye
My mama dey steady cast and binding
I give her joy every single time o
Na me dey make her dance like cocaina
As I dey grind every single time na she dey my mind
She dey send me prayers wey dey keep me tight
I pity anybody wey follow me fight (Follow me fight)
Ou yes I felt pain when I lost my Father
Ou yes I felt pain when I lost my brother
Ou yes I felt weight stacking on my shoulder
Omo it kept growing as I got older
The voice in my head told me i'm a soldier
Then I remember the time mama named me Divine
