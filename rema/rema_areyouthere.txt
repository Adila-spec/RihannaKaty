Are You There?

Ou yay ou yay ou yay huh

(One)
Another banger

People dey talk say na only woman I sabi talk about
So lemme make I just dey talk about am
I no fit focus on the negativity inside my country
So me I got to change the matter
I don talk I don shout I don vex I don calm
I don tweet I don cut my dada
Cruise no dey finish inside the country
So once in a while I got to turn up aha yay

Are you there are you there there there
Are you there are you there there there
You just dey smoke you no wan gree pass the J J J
You hear my song you no dey dance you no dey fear fear fear
Are you there are you there there there
Are you there are you there there there
You come my party come dey press phone for
Here here here you better losen up
And act like you don't care care care
(Bumba)

Girly with the biggie booty dey give me
This type of girl fit to kill person
Henessy dey put the girl for ecstasy
Monster dey boost my adrenaline
Make you no expect me to act orderly
Brotherly make nobody come dey bother me
Brotherly make nobodoy come dey judge me
Nobody here holy pass Mary Magdalene
On top my money you wan come dey shout for me
The one wey Buhari chop how many he cut for me
Make they play dorime dorime for the club for me aha
People dey die but people still dey go club that day
People no send e dey happen each and every other day
Casket plus the undertaker song wey dem they play I
Face reality cause me I no fit ever runaway
Way way way way way aha
Me I no fit ever runaway
Way way way way way aha
Wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up

Are you there are you there there there
Are you there are you there there there
You just dey smoke you no wan gree pass the J J J
You hear my song you no dey dance you no dey fear fear fear
Are you there are you there there there
Are you there are you there there there
You come my party come dey press phone for
Here here here you better losen up
And act like you don't care care care

Omo so many people just dey call my phone
So many people tell me make I come back home
I tell dem make dem lemme make I dey my own
President no dey country oya whats your own
My mama don dey worry about this my tone
Say anger don dey full inside all my flow
Omo as I dey serious I still dey joke
Omo as I dey serious I still dey joke
Omo as I dey serious
Cruise for Nigeria no fit ever stop
All the men for power no fit get enough
Why I wan dey let am try to weigh me down
Make I focus make I just dey hustle up
If you dey owe me make you pay me up
Dry chest boat cruise live it up
Make nobody tell me make I button up aha

Are you there are you there there there
Are you there are you there there there
You just dey smoke you no wan gree pass the J J J
You hear my song you no dey dance you no dey fear fear fear
Are you there are you there there there
Are you there are you there there there
You come my party come dey press phone for
Here here here you better losen up
And act like you don't care care care
