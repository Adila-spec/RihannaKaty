Rewind

Government y'all tell me what y'all governise
The people never organise
Even when I try to socialise
The people make me lose my mind
My people suffer
Political poker
I put the burden of the masses on my shoulder
Nobody badder tell me who that motherfucker
But the remedy I know
Girl dance to the beat and show
This one na bad man flow
Wine to the rhythm and slow
E dey make all the bad girl know

She dey move like a Tornado
She dey move like a Tornado
Cristiano Ronaldo
I no go play you like Ronaldo
Wine
Girla wine please don't waste my time
Wine
Bring it back baby come rewind
Wine
O baby wine please don't waste my time
Wine
Girla please come wine

Ama rock that pussy like a boat
(Like a boat)
Run up that bitch on a row
On a row
She say she will never let me go
Gonna mess up anybody for your love
I know dema be talking
I'm balling
My bling bling
Is shining
I'm balling
Your body
Is calling, oh

And no matter the sorrow
Sorrow
There's a better tomorrow
Morrow
Ama look out the window
Window
Dancing like I just won a lotto

Wine
Girla wine please don't waste my time
Wine
Bring it back baby come rewind
Wine
O baby wine please don't waste my time
Wine
Girla please come wine
