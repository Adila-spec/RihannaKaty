Boulevard

Yuh
Bad girl she told me she don't like me
She's an animal she just wanna bite me
She don't even wanna hear me she don't text me
Yeah because I couldn't afford a Nike
Other niggas they be trynna imitate me
Try to shoot at me but they can never take me
She be laughing at me cause I wore the same jeans
Undermining could've been my wifey

Cause she like another nigga in a boulevard
Cause she like another nigga in a boulevard
Cause she like another nigga in a boulevard
Yeah, cause she like another nigga in a boulevard
And the dirty nigga took her to the cinema
Why you feeling her? why you kissing her?
I'm pissed off finna cause a holocaust
I'm pissed off finna cause a holocaust

I don't need her, Monalisa
And I miss her, no picture
Hella pretty looking like a sunflower
Girl if I call you will you answer
Like Bruce Wayne like Bruce Wayne
Mehn I got the money, looking like am Bruce Wayne
Girl, it's too late, girl, it's too late
Finna let you go like a lose chain

Bad girl she told me she don't like me
She's an animal she just wanna bite me
She don't even wanna hear me she don't text me
Yeah because I couldn't afford a Nike
Other niggas they be tryna imitate me
They try they wanna take me
Huh wanna take me, no no way can't take me
