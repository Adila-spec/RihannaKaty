[Rema:]
Straight out of BC
We takin' the sound to the world you see
They don't really like me talkin' my shit like the OG's did
They hatin' on me cause I'ma—

Fresh young nigga cruisin' in a beamer
Fresh young nigga cruisin' in a beamer (It's Kel P vibes)
Fresh young nigga puffin' on a cigar
Fresh young nigga puffin' on a cigar

Wake up in the mornin' then I cook up in the kitchen
Put some water in the cup, ice freezin'
Seein' clips from last night intriguin'
I can't remember that chick I was kissin'
Couldn't even get her number
Hatin' ass niggas dema envy
When I dey with their babe in the VIP lounge
It's a young boy fresh P Star life
Seven zero P, yeah Star life
Me and my niggas we dey chop life
Top noche models on my bed side
All white shoes dema Off-white
Chat nonsense to me I'ma go offline
Miami beach, chillin' with the baddest bitch
Fuck her in the west, then I fly her to the south side

Ain't nobody fly like me, ahan
Spendin' on expensive shit, ahan
Neck and my wrist icy, ahan
Small boy, but I mighty, ahan
Ain't nobody fly like me, ahan
Spendin' on expensive shit, ahan
Neck and my wrist icy, ahan
Them never see this kind thing

Yes I'ma fresh young nigga
Celebrity crush in my villa
Take off her skirt and I give it to her
Raw, raw, raw
She want it raw, raw, raw
She said don't stop, stop, stop
She like it when I hit it from the
Bottom to the top
Then I took her for a ride, ride, ride
Cruisin' in the sun side
Fast money, fast life
Niggas wanna take my life
Yeah, yeah, why?

Ain't nobody fly like me, ahan
Spendin' on expensive shit, ahan
Neck and my wrist icy, ahan
Small boy, but I mighty, ahan
Ain't nobody fly like me, ahan
Spendin' on expensive shit, ahan
Neck and my wrist icy, ahan
Them never see this kind thing 

[AJ Tracey:]
(Yeah, yeah)
I'm the youngest nigga doin' this fly shit (Tracey)
And I ain't talkin' 'bout essentials my nigga (Uh)
I'm talkin' about the penthouse or the Arabic villa (That one)
Or the fresh Cuban cigars with the cannabis filler (Woah)
I'm on a different kind of time (That's right)
I grab the sea bass with the chopsticks and hit it with the lime (One time)
Ain't no askin' about my lady, you can bet that she's fine (Fine)
Body like the fourty-two and she gets better with time, yeah (Boo-boo)
The Maybach leather came in elephant's breath
These kinda colours you don't know unless your earnin's are blessed (Bling-blow)
Threw some shots of opposition not for war just a test (Uh)
Intoxicated by revenge, this heat is burning his chest (Cling, cling)
I got this suit in navy blue, but chose the burgundy breast
AP fresh, my watch collection murder the rest (Bling-blow)
You're hearin' lies if you ain't heard, I'm the best
Me and Rema for the remedy to purge you the stress, uh
