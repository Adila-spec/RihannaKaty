[Rema:]
Girl I'm never gonna leave
Baby I'm never gonna leave
Baby you the one I need
Love got me high like weed
Girl lets take a little trip
Take you to the island green
Feel up the island breeze
Kissing in the early morning beach
Hot sex got us sweating
Like we just coming out sauna
Pin your body for the corner
Girly imma get your body worn out

Tonight we go see as e go turn out
Sex hotter than a fucking furnace
Girly you go make my battery run down

I will never leave you you're my treasure
Oh girl I dey feel your tension
