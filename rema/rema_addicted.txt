Addicted

Oh yay yay yay
Ou yay ou yay ou yay
(I'm surfing)
Oh yay yay yay nah
Ou yay (I'm gone)

You're addicted to the lifestyle
Girl I know girl I know girl I know
Please baby can you take it slow
Every night and day you're always on the road
(Never getting old)
You're addicted to the lifestyle
Girl I know girl I know girl I know
Please baby can you take it slow
Every night and day you're always on the road

Oouu oouu
With me in the moon oouu
What can I do oouu
I'm stuck in the blue oouu

Yay got me dashed out
Hop in my race car and I rushed out
Playing the trap card (yah)
I really think she using me to cash out
She got me living like a rockstar
My homie called me telling me to slow it down
Race car to the bus stop
She gone make sure that you messed up
Oouu she wanna fuck me and the crew
I'm coming with the proof you got no excuse
I'm weighed down (yah)
You desperate really acting weird now
Do you know you're messing with a real one
Playing with me you got me let down
You got me real stuck got me pinned down
Love is not a source of income
I think it's time I put my pen down
It's time I go away and lay low
Pants down hoe got her pants down
Couple nigga wank out couple rounds now
I give it till 10 nigga tap out addicted to sex she's a monster
Baby room full of coke it's a hunid pound (yay)
So sad when I saw you lying down on the ground
Heeee
